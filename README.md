# [Oops! I Kill It Again](https://github.com/laylaone22/OIKIA)

How many times have you gotten a plant as a present? Or bought yourself one just for fun?
How many times have you prepared your garden, looking forward to the best harvest of your life?

How happy were you when you watered your green friends for the first time and promised yourself to take care of them?

Unfortunately the reality is that you probably killed them all again, and again... and again!!

We want to put an end to this with Oops! I Killed It Again (OIKIA)!

OIKIA is a MERN full-stack web application which helps you to:

- Gather information about your green friends, keeping them in a list of your favorite plants
- Organize your gardens, either indoor or outdoor (...yes, your room or balcony CAN be a garden!)
- Plan your garden arrangement using an interactive garden interface to make your life easier and more fun.
- Place your favorite plants correctly by checking their good and bad companions.
- Get an overview of your plants and notifications for when they need your attention.
